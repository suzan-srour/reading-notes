*What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?* Mounting
When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase.
*Put the following things in the order that they happen:* render,constructor ,componentDidMount,React Updates ,componentWillUnmount

 *What does componentDidMount do?*This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here.

*What types of things can you pass in the props?* intail data , raw data that the HTML output derives from.
*What is the big difference between props and state?* state is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.
*When do we re-render our application?*Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered. These lifecycle events happen during updating in this order.
*What are some examples of things that we could store in state?* button componant, prototype,fiching data
